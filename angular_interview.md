The command **`npm install -g @angular/cli`** is used to globally install the **Angular CLI** (Command Line Interface) tool, which is essential for creating, building, and managing Angular applications. Here's a breakdown of its components:

---

### **Command Breakdown**

1. **`npm`**: 
   - Stands for **Node Package Manager**.
   - It is a tool that comes with Node.js and is used to manage JavaScript packages or libraries.

2. **`install`**:
   - This tells `npm` to download and install a package or library.

3. **`-g`**:
   - This flag stands for **global installation**.
   - It installs the package globally on your system, making it accessible from anywhere on your machine.
   - Without this flag, the package would be installed locally in the current project directory.

4. **`@angular/cli`**:
   - Refers to the **Angular CLI** package.
   - The Angular CLI is a powerful command-line tool for initializing, developing, and maintaining Angular applications.

### **What Does This Command Do?**
1. Downloads the **Angular CLI** package from the npm registry.
2. Installs it globally on your system so that you can use Angular CLI commands (e.g., `ng new`, `ng serve`, `ng build`) from any directory in your terminal.

### **Why Install Angular CLI Globally?**
- **Global Usage**: Installing globally ensures the `ng` command is available system-wide, allowing you to create and manage Angular projects from anywhere.
- **Development Convenience**: You won't need to install the CLI separately for every project unless you want a specific version for a specific project.
